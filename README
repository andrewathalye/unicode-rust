"unicode" is a simple rust utility that can convert an arbitrary input stream between any form of UTF-32 and UTF-8.
It can also be used in the reverse direction, and swap between UTF-32BE and UTF-32LE.
A potential use case for this could be converting emoji (which can be easily seen in UTF-32 notation) into UTF-8 text that
can be inserted anywhere.

The program is used as follows:
unicode -f/-t -l/-b/-s < input > output
where:
-f means destination is UTF-8 and input is UTF-32
-t means destination is UTF-32, input could be UTF-8 or UTF-32.

-l means UTF-32LE source/destination
-b means UTF-32BE source/destination
-s means byteswap UTF-32 -> UTF-32
